1. Fortran comments are preceded by an exclamation mark.

2. No, Fortran is not case sensitive.

3. Intrinsic functions are built-in functions in Fortran. 
 Examples: Intrinsic mathematical functions like SQRT(x) for finding square root of a number X, LOG(X) for natural logarithm ; conversion functions like FLOOR(X) , FRACTION(X)

4. Difference between function and subroutine is that function returns a value (using a return statement) whereas subroutines dont have a return statement.

5. Integer and real variables in Fortran can be implicitly typed by using the FORTRAN naming convention. This convention states that a variable beginning with i, j, k, l, m, or n is an integer, and all other variables are real.

6. Implicit none statement is used to override implicit typing.

7. Common block is a shared memory area, used for passing information between program units. The data stored in common block is passed between program units through a 'COMMON' statement at the begnning of each program unit.

8. A module is a program unit that packages collections of declarations and subprograms.
These can be imported to other subprograms and re-used. A module contains declarations and functions that can be used by other modules and functions.
